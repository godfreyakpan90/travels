					<description><![CDATA[<p>As an ideal destination for  students, Germany offers some of the best conditions to pursue a degree and enjoy an authentic German experience. There are many reasons why Germany makes a go-to destination for foreign students, starting with the fact that it is truly inexpensive for most people.In comparison to other study destinations outside of Europe, living in Germany as a student comes at a lower cost. However, living in a foreign country while being far away from home means you must possess perfect skills in financial management.It has been estimated that the living costs in Germany are around €934 per month. Since this can prove to be a challenge for international students, there are programs that offer students the opportunity to apply for financial support in the form of a scholarship.
